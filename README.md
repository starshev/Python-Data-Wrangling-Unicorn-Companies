# Python Data Wrangling Â· Unicorns

This educational project involves data wrangling with a special focus on handling the missing values, exploratory analysis, data structuring and visualization.

Scenario: I am financial data consultant, and an investor has tasked my team with identifying new business opportunities.

The investor has asked me to provide them with the following data:

Companies in the Hardware industry based in either Beijing, San Francisco or London.
Companies in the Artificial Intelligence industry based in London.
A list of the top 20 countries sorted by sum of company valuations in each country, excluding United States, China, India and United Kingdom.

To help them decide which future companies to invest in, I need to provide a list of current businesses valued at more than $1 billion. These are sometimes referred to as "unicorns." My client will use this information to learn about profitable businesses in general.
