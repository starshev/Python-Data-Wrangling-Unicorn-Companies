# Python Data Wrangling · Unicorns

This educational project involves data wrangling with a special focus on handling the missing values, exploratory analysis, data structuring and visualization.

It simulates a workplace scenario where I am analyzing the data on unicorn companies — those valued at over one billion dollars - as a financial data analyst.

This project is aimed to highlight my technical competencies in Python for data analysis.

The work was conducted using Jupyter Notebooks and is presented in PDF format.
