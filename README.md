# Python Data Wrangling Â· Unicorns

This educational project involves data wrangling with a special focus on handling the missing values, exploratory analysis, data structuring and visualization.

Scenario: I am financial data consultant, and an investor has tasked my team with identifying new business opportunities. To help them decide which future companies to invest in, I need to provide a list of current businesses valued at more than $1 billion. These are sometimes referred to as "unicorns." My client will use this information to learn about profitable businesses in general.
